# Dockerbased Atlassian Environment
In this project we will set up an integrated environment of the Atlassian
development tools using Docker. The target is to have an easy way to bring up
an environment for demo purposes.

While it should also work for production this is not a use case we are eager to
support as Atlassian also does not. For production we suggest to deploy the
tools in a way that has support by Atlassian.
